# BB9E

Code for a remote controller using Bluetooth and a hacked wii nunchuck
This code was written  for my BB9E robot platform, you can read more about 
at https://www.alejandrowurts.com/tags/bb9e/ and https://www.alejandrowurts.com/projects/bb9e-v1-update-6-wii-remote/

Due to lack of time this project is not currently being worked on, but I plan to refactor it into something else later
